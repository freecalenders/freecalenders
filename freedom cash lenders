You can face dire financial consequences for failing to pay your student loans. Lenders will report the delinquency to the credit bureaus, which means your credit score will take a hit. Lenders could also sell the debt to a collection agency that decides to sue you in court. You’ll also have a harder time getting approved for future credit products with favorable terms. In some instances, you could face wage garnishment or have tax refunds withheld by the federal government.

If you’re experiencing financial difficulty and approaching student loan default, it’s worth reaching out to your lender to explore forms of relief that may be available to you.
